            <h2>Step 4: Move Towards Your Partner</h2>
            <p>While you are moving your arms in you are also going to
                take three small steps towards the direction of your partner.<br>
                Make sure the arms and the steps are synchronized.

            <h2>Step 5: Lift Knee Up</h2>
            <p>Both you and your partner will lift their outer knee up.
                Make sure the knee is pointed away from your partner.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h2>Step 6: Arms Out/Knees In</h2>
            <p>Now you and your partner are going to swing your arms away from each other
                (like in the starting position). At the same time you will turn your knee
                toward your partner. This should be done simultaneously.

            <h2>Step 7: Final Step</h2>
            <p>Extend your leg (with the knee up) out and away from each other while pointing your
                fingertips towards your partner. Touch each other's fingers to complete the fusion dance.
